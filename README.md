# Simple windows application using tkinter and api calls.

A project created in order to get familiar with the tkinter graphics library and its possibilities.

# How the application works?
The application is divided into 4 different headings that perform different functions.
<br />
1. The first is a simple currency converter using simple API calls.
2. The second header is also a currency converter only here we can swap with cryptocurrencies.
3. A third headline upcoming IPO of companies also pulls data from a free API.
4. The fourth headline lists upcoming financial reports of stock market companies with earnings estimates. 

## Webpages from which API CALLS data is taken:

* https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ [currency converter]
* https://www.alphavantage.co/ [financial reports, IPO of companies, crypto/currency converter]
